                    <h2>I'm not broken, I just think differently</h2>
                    <p class="tab1">
                      I am dyslexic. I didn't know it till I was in my late 20's when I was questioned about it. 
                      I know I had a hard time with some things. I just figured everyone had trouble with this stuff. 
                      You know the saying. “I'm having a dyslexic moment” or something similar. I didn't have words 
                      swim across the pages, so I figured I just wasn't as skillful as other people. Everyone has 
                      straights and weaknesses right? Left and right. Everyone gets confused about that.<br>
                      Then I found out that what is shown as dyslexic is the extreme cases. Not every dyslexic has 
                      swimming letters. Dyslexic is a wiring difference in the brain, and its effects are varied. 
                      Like I have an issue with keeping left and right straight but I don't have an issue with north 
                      and south. Some have issues with both. When I do any more than basic math I'm relying on counting 
                      tricks like fingers or dots on paper to keep everything in order. Back in the day I thought I was 
                      just bad at math, now I understand that's part of dyslexia. Even friendship and social is effected 
                      by dyslexia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="tab1">
                      Even with all the issues that come with dyslexia I have did my associates degree, learned to code, 
                      finished a Nanodegree from Udacity. Managed teams of up to 25 people. Wrote How To manuals for 
                      common network and computer issues. Trouble shoot obscure issues, and fixed critical servers under 
                      the stress of production deadlines waiting on it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="tab1">
                      The hardest part of all of this is trying to tell other people I understand all this and I'm good 
                      at it. With dyslexia I miss social ques and its hard to make and keep friends, and in the field of 
                      hardware administrator its all about who you know. Not really what you know. I have worked side by 
                      side with people with out a degree. no real background. No network understanding. No previous work 
                      experience. When I ask how did you get this job? The answer is always the same. “My buddy got me 
                      this job.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="tab1">
                      It use to get me upset. I been working my butt off doing this stuff learning all I can for about 
                      25 years now, and I would get the odd job, or gig to setup stuff for someone. But didn't really 
                      make an income from it. Couldn't quit my job to work in the field I been wanting to work in. and 
                      here some guy that woke up one day and thought “hay I want to try this admin thing” and in a couple 
                      phone calls has a job paying good money.
                    </p>
                    <p class="tab1">
                      Now days, I don't get upset anymore. Its a pointless waste of energy. I figured out if I can show 
                      my work rather than try to tell someone about it. Ill be able to show off how much I have done, 
                      plus if I can freelance my software skills or even build a software empire on google play I could 
                      make my own streams of income. I could freelance my own hours. Or I could get a 9-5 and just build 
                      stuff for other people.
                    </p>
                    <p class="tab1">
                      So here is my work, my display case, for the world to see how much I have done and what I can do. 
                    </p>
