			  <small>	
				   I been programming as a hobby starting in the mid 90's. I have tried out different languages over the years.
				   I have worked with BASIC (both VB6 and VB.NET), C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and XML. I have listed some of my personal projects here.
				   The two things i like the most is building things and overcoming challenges, programming gives me both,
			    so I am trying to make programming my full time career.

          <h3>Educational android App</h3>
          <p>Date finished 10/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
            I used one of the project app as a base and built on to it. I expanded its data set and added some
            features. This program uses a list view and a view adapter on a tabbed layout using fragments. All the
            items go to the same activity intent and that activity changes how its laid out depending on whats passed to it.

          <p>Date finished 9/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
            This project app for Udacity's course it teaches how to use SQLlite database to quire data, insert new data or update data in a data base. This app has a sale button on each
            item that will update the screen and data base each time a item is sold. It also uses a background loader so the database loading wont hang the user interface. When a item
            is touched it will take the user to a new screen to edit the details of the item in the data base. The user can also add new items to the data base with the options menu in
            the top activity bar.

          <p>Date finished 7/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
            This project app for Udacity's course is to practice working with data over the internet. I uses guardian news API to request news story's that the user
            requests. Sports, weather and so on. It receives this as a JSON object and parses the desired information from it to populate the screen. Each news item
            will open the correct story in the users favorite browser.
            This app uses multi threads to allow it to wait for the JSON object to come over the network and not freeze the UI to give a better user experience.

            lot of cool things out there to see. Each item on the list will take you to the details page, this required sending other data with the intent
            so the new activity can pull the right information from the array of planets stored.

          <p>Date finished 3/2018 using HTML & JavaScript<br>
				     When filling out a lot of information box's that requests the same information. I was highlighting, then copy/paste the information from a text doc.
				     This got tedious and the random missing of a letter at the start or end started getting annoying, so I built this Web App to handle the copy for me.
				     when the button is clicked it will fill the a box with the right information, then copy this to the clipboard ready to paste where ever I need it.
				     I can also pull the browser tab out to its own window allowing it to act like its own app. I choose to build this in HTML because the browser will
				     handle all the UI for me, speeding up the development process.

				    The app also will send this info through the phones email using intents with the android framework so the users favorite email app.

            Date finished 11/2017 using C++<br> 
            This was a bit more challenging, I first built it with an array and the compiler would put random things to the 
            last array variable. Such as random ASCII character, or it would add (x,o) to that variable.
				    I realized the array wasn't doing anything for the program, so I removed it and fixed the issue.

          <p>
            Date finished 1997 using QuickBasic<br> 
            This was one of my first artificial intelligence programs. It has a player on the left and right of the
            screen. One of the players can be human or computer player, so you can play with a friend or solo.
            The center blocks move up and down and will block shoots. I added this to put some fun dynamic
            to the game.
            The hard part was balancing the artificial intelligence so that it can be hit but not to easy. I also
            figured out a way for it to try and hit the human player so the human player can't just sit in one spot.

				    I built this program to push the limits of what i could do with QuickBasic.<br>
				    It was really challenging and due to only having a 486 computer it didn't run very fast. <br>
				    Some of the things I did differently was to use a read/data to load array tables,<br>
				    and sine/cosine for the math to draw the walls properly.

          <h3>Power elf</h3>
          <p>
            Date finished 1998 using QuickBasic<br>
            This program was months in the making. It has 2 players and was built around a race to the finish.
            It has many features such as hand to hand weapon, ranged weapon and bombs that can be placed. 
            There are many types of keys and doors. Teleporters breakable and pushable walls and the graphics animate. <br>
            When a player dies he is sent to a level specific waiting area until next round. There's also 2 types
            of artificial intelligence built in to the game. One fallows a path and the other will search the maze
            for the players.<br>
            I overcome many problems building this program from complex arrays to condensing code to fit more
            features in to the 640k memory limit of QuickBasic. Building a smart maze running artificial intelligence
            that wont get stuck. Loading levels from files and parsing the infomation to find key points on the map.
