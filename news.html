	Its a mile stone today. My domain guruvex.com is one year old. It went so fast, but you know 
	what they say. When your having fun time fly's. Well I guess its been a fun year. Busy year 
	anyway. New place, in-laws move in. new pets. Growing kids. It gets crazy.<br>
	Now that's behind me its time to look forward and freelance to freedom. I have started picking 
	up clients for random computer jobs, virus/malware removal mostly, and some leads on other 
	skills I have. I'm also starting to explore some freelancing platforms, and start coding as 
	my main stream business.<br>

	What a crazy summer. Just when I thought I would get rolling on software, other issues came
	 up. I ended up just taking the rest of the summer off to take care of personal issues. It 
	 was a nice brake but now I am back on the ball and trying to find work as a software developer.<br>
	 I also added a new app to the app store and have ideas for 2 others I'm working on.

	Crazy time. I got a new computer. Big upgrade that was long over due. What I was using was 
	an old toss out laptop from work because it was newer then my really old machine that was 
	failing. It served me well for 8 years, but its time had come.<br>
	So I got a new system, logged in to everything and got all the software I needed. Then the 
	keyboard failed. (great. I got the lucky lemon).<br>
	There only option was send it in for repair, it will be gone for 3 weeks. Ahhhh.. ok.<br>
	3 weeks go by with out a system, and I get it back, but the keyboard still didn't work. It 
	was repaired for a broken hinge... that wasn't broken when it left me.<br>
	Back to the store. After an hour of arguing I finely get it replaced. (what I wanted in the 
	first place).<br> 
	So now after logging in to everything and getting all the software again!. I'm back on course.

	Its been a hard few months. Moving is a lot of work, and the place we moved in to needed a 
	little upkeep. It seems every little project takes all day. The fluorescent bulbs that was 
	put in many years ago take forever to light up, so I been changing them to LED. Put in a 
	washer and dryer. That's not hard. I have done before. But then, vent pipes don't match, 
	Old pipes leak and need replaced. By the time I get it all done the day is over. <br>
	One reason I moved here was to be closer to my parents. I also been setting aside one day a 
	week to help them around there house. <br>
	Now that I'm getting on top of things ill be getting back to my dart lessons, and working on 
	my android apps.

	Started a Udemy course of Flutter. The one from Udacity was getting me a bit lost. This one 
	starts with dart, then builds in to the flutter framework. Its really small pieces that make 
	it easy to find a stopping spot. As it turns out dart has some cool features I wish Java had. 
	Such as giving an object variable a value from the method call with This.myValue.

	Then there was blog.<br>
	I have added a blog space to my web page. I didn't want to just link to blogger or something 
	like that. I wanted the challenge of building a manageable setup to post my own blogs. I like 
	the coding practice.

	Found a course on Udacity that I can learn the basics of 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://flutter.io/">flutter.</a> I have an app idea that would be 
	hard to build for both iOS and android plus maintain. It don't require 
	anything hardware (right now) so flutter would be a nice fit for this app.

	Refactoring is done. The app works better for mobile now. 
	It wasn't to hard, thanks to bootstrap.

	I need my site to respond better to mobile devices and different screen sizes. So I'm 
	refactoring the site to use bootstrap, and learning how to use the bootstrap framework 
	at the same time. Ill be swapping pages over one at a time as I get them done. So the page 
	will look fragmented until I'm done.

	currently working on my first play store app.
	i am taking one of the projects i did and expanding the idea to a full app by
	making it unique and full of content. I still have some work to do on it. But it will get there.

	I did it. It was a lot of work and grit. Online study is hard. Takes a lot of discipline
	thankfully there is a great community to help when I would get stuck on something.
	This has been an amazing journey. Learned so much. I feel I can take on the world now.

	Good news everybody! I was able to get one of the spots for the full NanoDegree.
	Udacity says they received over 100k submissions for this scholarship.
	Out of that 100k only 25k were awarded the challenge.
	Out of the 25k only 7,500 were picked for the full NanoDegree.
	That's means only 1 out of every 14 that applied got this chance of a life time.
	I feel so lucky and blessed.
