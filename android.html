				I have built this page to show my work in android. I used android studio for all the projects.<br>
				I am really quite proud of the projects I did, when I started with Udacity I couldn't get a button 
				on the screen. After 8 months with there courses I'm making full apps and even have one on the play store.

          <p>Date finished 12/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
            We got tired of the recipe box going missing. We also didn't want to need an internet connection to get are recipes. 
            Or get suggestions or all the other bloat that comes with the recipes apps on the play store. So I made a personal 
            one. All the recipes are held in a java object so its easy to add to. The lists will adapt to whats returned from 
            the java object. The first activity has the list of recipes, the second activity is 2 fragments in a tabbed activity 
            to hold the ingredients and the how to cook it.

            I used one of the project app as a base and built on to it. I expanded its data set and added some
            features. This program uses a list view and a view adapter on a tabbed layout using fragments. All the
            items go to the same activity intent and that activity changes how its laid out depending on whats passed to it.

          <p>Date finished 9/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
            This project app for Udacity's course it teaches how to use SQLlite database to quire data, insert new data or update data in a data base. This app has a sale button on each
            item that will update the screen and data base each time a item is sold. It also uses a background loader so the database loading wont hang the user interface. When a item
            is touched it will take the user to a new screen to edit the details of the item in the data base. The user can also add new items to the data base with the options menu in
            the top activity bar.

          <p>Date finished 7/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
            This project app for Udacity's course is to practice working with data over the internet. I uses guardian news API to request news story's that the user
            requests. Sports, weather and so on. It receives this as a JSON object and parses the desired information from it to populate the screen. Each news item
            will open the correct story in the users favorite browser.
            This app uses multi threads to allow it to wait for the JSON object to come over the network and not freeze the UI to give a better user experience.

            the screen color and the slider shows its value in the text box under it.
