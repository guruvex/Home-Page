				I used one of the project app as a base and built on to it. I expanded its data set and added some<br>
				features. This program uses a list view and a view adapter on a tabbed layout using fragments. All the<br>
				items go to the same activity intent and that activity changes how its laid out depending on whats passed to it.<br>

				This project app for Udacity's course it teaches how to use SQLlite database to quire data, insert new data or update data in a data base. This app has a sale button on each<br>
				item that will update the screen and data base each time a item is sold. It also uses a background loader so the database loading wont hang the user interface. When a item<br>
				is touched it will take the user to a new screen to edit the details of the item in the data base. The user can also add new items to the data base with the options menu in<br>
				the top activity bar.

				Date finished 8/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
				This project app for Udacity's course is to practice working with data over the internet. I uses guardian news API to request news story's that the user
				requests. Sports, weather and so on. It receives this as a JSON object and parses the desired information from it to populate the screen. Each news item
				will open the correct story in the users favorite browser.<br>
				This app uses multi threads to allow it to wait for the JSON object to come over the network and not freeze the UI to give a better user experience.

				Date finished 7/2018 using Java, XML in android studio<br>
				This project app for Udacity's course is to better understand how to use the view adapter class, this project I picked space, because there's a<br>
				lot of cool things out there to see. Each item on the list will take you to the details page, this required sending other data with the intent<br>
				so the new activity can pull the right information from the array of planets stored.

				one of the first Grow with Google challenge projects. It's a one page app that displays a Udacity image and some required info. <br>
				The image choice and design is student choice.<br>
