				This project app for Udacity's course it teaches how to use SQLlite database to quire data, insert new data or update data in a data base. This app has a sale button on each<br>
				item that will update the screen and data base each time a item is sold. It also uses a background loader so the database loading wont hang the user interface. When a item<br>
				is touched it will take the user to a new screen to edit the details of the item in the data base. The user can also add new items to the data base with the options menu in<br>
				the top activity bar.

				This project app for Udacity's course is to practice working with data over the internet. I uses guardian news API to request news story's that the user
				requests. Sports, weather and so on. It receives this as a JSON object and parses the desired information from it to populate the screen. Each news item
				will open the correct story in the users favorite browser.<br>
				This app uses multi threads to allow it to wait for the JSON object to come over the network and not freeze the UI to give a better user experience.

				This project app for Udacity's course is to better understand how to use the view adapter class, this project I picked space, because there's a<br>
				lot of cool things out there to see. Each item on the list will take you to the details page, this required sending other data with the intent<br>
				so the new activity can pull the right information from the array of planets stored.

				This was a project for Udacity's android course. It's an app to teach users the MiWok language, it has tabs that group the category together. Colors,<br>
				numbers, and so on. Its build with a list so items can be added or removed very simply. It also plays audio for each item when clicked on.

				Date finished 3/2018 using HTML & JavaScript<br>
				When filling out a lot of information box's that requests the same information. I was highlighting, then copy/paste the information from a text doc.<br>
				This got tedious and the random missing of a letter at the start or end started getting annoying, so I built this Web App to handle the copy for me.<br>
				when the button is clicked it will fill the a box with the right information, then copy this to the clipboard ready to paste where ever I need it.<br>
				I can also pull the browser tab out to its own window allowing it to act like its own app. I choose to build this in HTML because the browser will<br>
				handle all the UI for me, speeding up the development process.

				Grow with Google challenge project, just java app is more complex than the udacity card app. This app will take the number of coffee's and calculate<br>
				the price. This app also lets the user choose to add chocolate or whipped cream topping and the total will change based on the users choices.<br>
				The app also will send this info through the phones email using intents with the android framework so the users favorite email app. <br>

				Date finished 1/2018 using Android Studio, Java & XML<br>
				one of the first Grow with Google challange projects. It's a one page app that displays a Udacity image and some required info. <br>
				The image choice and design is student choice.<br>
				I made the phone number and web link clickable to link to the phone call app and the default browser respectively.<br>
				I didn't like the default app name in the title bar so i changed that to its current Udacity Card title.
