									Found a course on Udacity that I can learn the basics of 
									<a target="_blank" href="https://flutter.io/">flutter.</a> I have an app idea that would be hard to build 
									for both iOS and android plus maintain. It don't require 
									anything hardware (right now) so flutter would be a nice 
									fit for this app.

								I need my site to respond better to mobile devices and
								different screen sizes. So I'm refactoring the site to
								use bootstrap, and learning how to use the bootstrap
								framework at the same time. Ill be swapping pages over
								one at a time as I get them done. So the page will look
								fragmented until I'm done.

								currently working on my first play store app.
								i am taking one of the projects i did and expanding the idea to a full app by

								I did it. It was a lot of work and grit. Online study is hard. Takes a lot of discipline
								thankfully there is a great community to help when I would get stuck on something.
								This has been an amazing journey. Learned so much. I feel I can take on the world now.

								Good news everybody! I was able to get one of the spots for the full NanoDegree.
								Udacity says they received over 100k submissions for this scholarship.
								Out of that 100k only 25k were awarded the challenge.
								Out of the 25k only 7,500 were picked for the full NanoDegree.
								That's means only 1 out of every 14 that applied got this chance of a life time.
								I feel so lucky and blessed.

					I been programming as a hobby starting in the mid 90's. I have tried out different languages over the years.
					I have worked with BASIC (both VB6 and VB.NET), C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and XML. I have listed some of my personal projects here.
					The two things i like the most is building things and overcoming challenges, programming gives me both,
				 so I am trying to make programming my full time career.
